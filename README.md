# Hey there, I'm Jun Han 👋

I like building AI systems that actually work in production. While I enjoy the research side of things, I'm mostly focused on the engineering challenges, figuring out how to make models reliable, factual, and efficient.

Right now I'm deep into **Small Language Models (SLMs)** and **Agentic RAG**. I am intrigued by the idea of taking massive transformer capabilities and optimizing them to run on smaller compute with stricter accuracy guardrails and on par performance.

If you are looking for my code, you'll find a mix of NLP research, full-stack apps, and some messy experiments.
